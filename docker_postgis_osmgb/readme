# Populates a postgis database with OSM data for GB.
# Uses Docker so we don't have to fight machines/installation and it'll always just work with little effort.

# Build the image, from this folder.
docker build -t osmgb .

# Run the image. Create /data/docker/osmgb first.
docker run -v /data/docker/osmgb:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 5432:5432 osmgb

# See what Docker has called your image, e.g unruffled_babbage
docker ps

# Set up the OSM GB data - takes hours
docker exec <container_name> su postgres -c populate_osm.sh

# Find the container's ip: (On my Mac this was 0.0.0.0)
    docker inspect <container_name> | grep HostIp

# Check that we can access the OSM geometry
python check.py 0.0.0.0
